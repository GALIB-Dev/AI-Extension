# Service Worker Build Fix

## Issue

"Failed to analyze text" errors occurred due to build system problems:

1. Old JavaScript service worker file was being used instead of updated TypeScript version
2. Missing AI service integration in the built file
3. Incorrect Vite configuration pointing to wrong entry file

## Root Cause

- `service-worker.js` (old) was overriding `service-worker.ts` (updated with AI)
- Vite was building `advanced-service-worker.ts` instead of correct `service-worker.ts`
- Import path issues preventing AI service integration

## Solution

### 1. File Cleanup
```bash
# Removed conflicting old file
rm src/background/service-worker.js
```

### 2. Fixed Vite Configuration
```typescript
// vite.config.ts
build: {
  rollupOptions: {
    input: {
      'service-worker': resolve(__dirname, "src/background/service-worker.ts")
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Corrected Import Path
```typescript
// service-worker.ts
import { aiService } from '../../../shared/src/ai-service';
```

## Verification

### Build Output
```
dist/assets/ai-service-CQfPPnq7.js       7.09 kB  ✅ AI service included
dist/src/background/service-worker.js    8.13 kB  ✅ Service worker with AI
```

### Built Code Contains
- AI service integration: `await m.loadApiKeys()`
- Text analysis: `m.explainFinancialText(e)`
- Multi-provider fallback chain

## Results

**Before:**
- Basic keyword matching only
- Limited to hardcoded terms
- Frequent "failed to analyze" errors

**After:**
- Full AI provider chain (Chrome AI → OpenAI → Claude → Gemini → Local)
- High-quality explanations for any financial text
- Reliable fallback system

## Status

✅ **Resolved** - Service worker now properly integrates AI service with multi-provider support.
